They are endoparasites of vines in the genus Tetrastigma (Vitaceae), spreading their absorptive organ, the haustorium, inside the tissue of the vine. The only part of the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the five-petaled flower. This is NOT a symbiotic relationship. It IS a parasitic relationship. Source(s): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia",

The only part of the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the five-petaled flower. In some species, such as Rafflesia arnoldii, the flower may be over 100 centimetres (39 in) in diameter, and weigh up to 10 kilograms (22 lb). Even the smallest species, R. baletei, has 12 cm diameter flowers. Moreover, because Amorphophallus has the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, it is sometimes mistakenly credited as having the world's largest flower. Both Rafflesia and Amorphophallus are flowering plants, but they are only distantly related.",
      "1 Rafflesia is the largest individual flower. 2  Titan arum bears the largest inflorescence. 3  Rafflesia is a parasite which attaches itself to a host plant, Tetrastigma vine, which grows only in undisturbed rainforests, to obtain water and nutrients. Similar in line with the Rafflesia, which is the largest single flower, The titan arum-Amorphophallus titanum, is the largest unbranched inflorescence in the world of flowering plants. Italian botanist Odoardo Beccari discovered the Titan Arum in Sumatra in 1878. Titan arum is also the native of rainforests of Sumatra.",

The rafflesia flower, found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia, is actually a parasite which grows on only one type of vine. When the enormous flower blooms, it emits the smell of rotting meat to attract insects-the rafflesia's only hope for reproduction."

Immediate medical attention is especially important if the floaters are accompanied by flashes of light or a loss of side vision. If you have these symptoms, see an eye doctor right away. If available, choose an ophthalmologist with retinal expertise. Without immediate treatment, you can have permanent vision loss. Eye floaters are small moving spots that appear in your field of vision. They may be especially noticeable when you look at something bright, such as white paper or a blue sky. Eye floaters can be annoying, but they generally don't interfere with your sight.",

      "Age-related changes to the eye are the most common cause of eye floaters. The cornea and lens at the front of the eye focus light onto the retina at the back of the eye. As the light passes from the front of the eye to the back, it passes through the vitreous humor, a jelly-like substance inside your eyeball. Because the floaters are inside the fluid of your eye, they will move as your eyes move. If you try to look right at them, they will dart out of your vision. Eye floaters commonly appear when you stare at a bright, plain surface, such as the sky, a reflective object, or blank paper.",

Carbon is unique in its ability to form large, diverse molecules because of the way it forms electronic bonds with other atoms. The chemical bonds carbon forms allow it to form long molecular chains essential to life as we know it. In an unsaturated fat, some carbon atoms form double bonds with other atoms. These double bonds create a kink in the tail of the fatty acid, which means that the molecules can’t pack tightly together.

All matter is made up of atoms, and atoms are made up of smaller particles. The three main particles making up an atom are the proton, the neutron and the electron.

      "Use [edit]. The main application of sodium chlorite is the generation of chlorine dioxide for bleaching and stripping of textiles, pulp, and paper. It is also used for disinfection of municipal water treatment plants after conversion to chlorine dioxide. In organic synthesis, sodium chlorite is frequently used as a reagent in the Pinnick oxidation for the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. The reaction is usually performed in monosodium phosphate buffered solution in the presence of a chlorine scavenger (usually 2-methyl-2-butene).",
      "Sodium chlorite is a compound used for water disinfection and purification. It is produced in large quantities as flakes or a solution from chlorine dioxide and sodium hydroxide. Its use as a bleach for textiles was first discovered during the 1920s. When put in an acid solution, sodium chlorite breaks down into chlorine dioxide. When added to a municipal water supply, chlorine dioxide helps control unwanted tastes and odors. It also aids in the removal of ions like iron and manganese. One added benefit is that it helps eliminate trihalomethanes in drinking water",

      "Sodium chlorite is a salt-based chemical that also features the element chlorine. It has several practical uses and is very similar to sodium chlorate, a common food additive. Most people interact with sodium chlorite frequently but do not realize it, because the chemical is rarely interacted with in large portions. One of the primary uses of sodium chlorite is as a oxidizer. It is helpful in bleaching various types of materials, such as wood, oils, and other textile products. It can help deactivate many types of poisons by interacting with them and changing their chemical composition."

      "This metric indicates costs relative to electrical power output. The cost of solar panels have decreased significantly over the last decade and are currently selling for under $0.70/W in industrial quantities. For homeowners, this translates to about $1.5/W. We decided to pull together all aspects of this question, and write the best resource on the costs of solar panels you will find on the entire Internet. Residential solar systems are typically sized from 3 to 8kW and end up costing between $15,000 and $40,000."

      "Cardiac tamponade: A life-threatening situation in which there is such a large amount of fluid (usually blood) inside the pericardial sac around the heart that it interferes with the performance of the heart. If cardiac tamponade is left untreated, the result is dangerously low blood pressure, shock, and death. The excess fluid in the pericardial sac acts to compress and constrict the heart.

Cardiac tamponade is a serious medical condition in which blood or fluids fill the space between the sac that encases the heart and the heart muscle, placing extreme pressure on the heart. The resulting pressure prevents the heart's ventricles from expanding fully and keeps the heart from functioning properly. The treatment of cardiac tamponade is generally twofold: relieving pressure on your heart and then treating the underlying condition. Initial treatment involves getting you stabilized. Your doctor will also drain the fluid from your pericardial sac, typically with a needle in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.",

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Cardiac tamponade, also known as pericardial tamponade, is an acute type of pericardial effusion in which fluid, pus, blood, clots, or gas accumulates in the pericardium (the sac in which the heart is enclosed), resulting in slow or rapid compression of the heart."

      "work - (physics) a manifestation of energy; the transfer of energy from one physical system to another expressed as the product of a force and the distance through which it moves a body in the direction of that force; work equals force times distance. Energy can exist in a variety of forms, such as electrical, mechanical, chemical, thermal, or nuclear, and can be transformed from one form to another. It is measured by the amount of work done, usually in joules or watts. See more at law of conservation of energy.",
      "Energy transfer. Energy transfer is the transfer of energy from one object or material to another. There are a few main ways that energy transfer occurs: ⁕Radiant energy ⁕Heat conduction ⁕Convection ⁕Mass transfer ⁕Electrical power transmission ⁕Mechanical work. It includes the transfer of kinetic energy and the transfer of chemical energy. The transfer of chemical energy from one molecule to another depends on proximity of molecules so it is often used as in techniques to measure distance such as the use of FORSTER RESONANCE ENERGY TRANSFER."

      "Where Do Thresher Sharks Live. Thresher sharks are pelagic fish as they are often found in a depth of about 500 meters (1,600 feet); they seldom dive deep in the shallow waters. Common threshers are often found in continental shelves of Asia, North America, and North Pacific. 1 These shark species are active predators. 2  They have small mouth and large eyes. 3  Common thresher is by far the largest thresher with a length of about 6.1 meters (20 feet). 4  The weight of these sharks is around 500 kg (1,100 lb). 5  The length of bigeye thresher measure around 4.9 meters (16 feet).",
      "The discovery explains why thresher sharks are often caught by their tails by baited long-line fishing gear. Three species of thresher shark swim the oceans: the common thresher (Alopias vulpinus), bigeye thresher (A. superciliosus) and pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus) . Each species has a similar general appearance, including an elongated tail which can extend up to half the total shark's length.",
      "Fox shark is the earliest known English name for this species and is rooted in classical antiquity, from a belief that it was especially cunning. In the mid-19th century, the name fox was mostly superseded by thresher, referencing the shark's flail-like use of its tail. It is also known by many other common names, including Atlantic thresher, grayfish, green thresher, long-tailed shark, sea ape, sea fox, slasher, swiveltail, thintail thresher, thrasher shark, and whiptail shark."

One example was a railway bridge Roebling constructed between 1851-1855 across the Niagra River gorge.

The first design for a bridge resembling the modern suspension bridge is attributed to Venetian polymath Fausto Veranzio, whose 1595 book Machinae Novae included drawings both for a timber and rope suspension bridge, and a hybrid suspension and cable-stayed bridge using iron chains (see gallery below)."

      "Leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone. Both hormones act on receptors in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to regulate appetite to achieve energy homeostasis. When leptin binds with the leptin receptor, it activates a number of pathways. Leptin resistance may be caused by defects in one or more part of this process, particularly the JAK / STAT pathway. Mice with a mutation in the leptin receptor gene that prevents the activation of STAT3 are obese and exhibit hyperphagia.",

      "If a patient gets 12 eye injections in a year, the doctor will make $650 more per patient if they use Lucentis over Avastin. Similarly, there is no financial incentive for Genentech to sell less Lucentis and more Avastin. When Avastin is used to treat cancer patients, it is often delivered at more than 100 times the dose needed for an eye injection, and a full course of Avastin treatment for cancer can cost up to $50,000 per patient. The switch could also save patients $5 billion in insurance copayments, according to a new study in Health Affairs. Ranibizumab, more commonly known by its brand name Lucentis, is delivered as an injection to the eye and runs about $2,023 per dose. Many patients require up to 12 injections per year. That's why some doctors choose to prescribe the much cheaper drug Avastin (bevacizumab) instead, which costs around $55 per dose",

Lactose is the main carbohydrate or sugar found in milk, and in varying quantities in dairy products made from milk including yoghurt, ice cream, soft cheeses and butter. Lactose is digested in the small intestine by an enzyme called lactase. This enzyme allows the body to break down the lactose into two simple sugars, glucose and galactose."

Action researchers examine their interactions and relationships in social setting seeking opportunities for improvement. Margaret Riel. Each of us will come to understand action research as a tension between forces that lead to personal, professional and social change. I think of action research is a process of deep inquiry into one's practices in service of moving towards an envisioned future, aligned with values. Action research, can be seen as a systematic, reflective study of one's actions, and the effects of these actions, in a workplace or organizational contex",

This is commonly referred to as the simplest part of the brain, as most creatures on the evolutionary scale have some form of brain creation that resembles the brain stem. The brain stem consists of midbrain, pons and medulla.",
      "The frontal lobe contains most of the dopamine-sensitive neurons in the cerebral cortex. The dopamine system is associated with reward, attention, short-term memory tasks, planning, and motivation. ",
      "The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium.",
      "The hindbrain includes the upper part of the spinal cord, the brain stem, and a wrinkled ball of tissue called the cerebellum (1). The hindbrain controls the body’s vital functions such as respiration and heart rate. The cerebellum coordinates movement and is involved in learned rote movements. The brain is like a committee of experts. All the parts of the brain work together, but each part has its own special properties. The brain can be divided into three basic units: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain."

      "Event Details. Tony Welsh, President of Barbecana Inc., will deliver this presentation. His presentation will explain how schedule risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation works, with particular reference to a phenomenon known as merge bias, which makes most deterministic project plans overly optimistic.",
      "This is the merge bias effect, and the results for project completion are compounded by the number of merge bias points through a schedule that are effected by schedule risk. Consider the following example of a single activity driving a completion milestone, the activity (and whole project) most likely duration is 100days, there is minimum duration of 80days, and a maximum of 120 days.",
      "It is important to assess risk of bias in all studies in a review irrespective of the anticipated variability in either the results or the validity of the included studies. For instance, the results may be consistent among studies but all the studies may be flawed. Because the results of a study may in fact be unbiased despite a methodological flaw, it is more appropriate to consider risk of bias. Differences in risks of bias can help explain variation in the results of the studies included in a systematic review (i.e. can explain heterogeneity of results).",

      "Article. ABSTRACT. In the performance of a probabilistic schedule analysis, more commonly known as a schedule risk analysis, the phenomena of merge bias impacts most project results. However, this impact is typically poorly understood by project teams and management, who the analysis is intended to benefit. It also discusses how to consider and address merge bias in the construction of a schedule risk model. The use of schedule risk analysis to identify probabilistic project completion dates is becoming more common in current project management."

      "Static electricity is the buildup of electrical charges on the surface of some object or material. Static electricity is usually created when materials are pulled apart or rubbed together, causing positive (+) charges to collect on one material and negative (−) charges on the other surface. Static electricity is formed much better when the air is dry or the humidity is low. When the air is humid, water molecules can collect on the surface of various materials. This can prevent the buildup of electrical charges. The reason has to do with the shape of the water molecule and its own electrical forces.",
      "if you get a static shock You can find if something is charged in several ways. One way is to see if it will discharge onto you or another surface. However, not all charged ob … jects will discharge on the surface you present. SO, you can use a homemade charge detector like a Versorium or bring something with very little mass (like pepper flakes) and see if it will induce a charge and attract them.",
      "Static control flooring can be defined as a flooring system that can drain and/or dissipate static charges by grounding personnel, equipment or other objects contacting the floor surface or that controls the generation and accumulation of static charges. Static dissipative materials have electrical resistance between insulative and conductive materials. Like a conductive floor material, the charges generated triboelectrically on the static dissipative floor can be transferred to ground but the process of this transferring takes longer than in a conductive floor.",
      "Rubbing against skin. The number-one cause of getting an excess of static electricity charges in your body is rubbing certain materials against your skin. This is especially true if you have dry skin. Synthetic materials such as polyester clothes are the major culprits. Also, some people see to have a tendency to build up static electric charges in their bodies. The problem may be due to their body chemistry, such that their blood has an excess of ions. One theory is that too much salt in your system causes that problem. Another theory is that your system is too acidic.",
      "Static electricity is an imbalance of electric charges within or on the surface of a material. The charge remains until it is able to move away by means of an electric current or electrical discharge. The phenomenon of static electricity requires a separation of positive and negative charges. When two materials are in contact, electrons may move from one material to the other, which leaves an excess of positive charge on one material, and an equal negative charge on the other."

Despite the term spurs, they are actually small round lumps of extra bone that grow around joints. Osteophytes are the body’s attempt to compensate for existing bone and ligament degeneration due to age or injury. ",
      "By Michael Perry, M.D. Anterior osteophytes are bone spurs that develop on the front, or anterior aspect, of the vertebrae. They appear to be more common in the cervical spine (neck) than in other spinal segments, as the neck is considerably more prone to degenerative conditions that contribute to osteophyte formation. Anterior osteophytes develop on the front side of the vertebrae, largely because the spine’s structure allows the anterior side to compress further than the posterior. The result is that anterior osteophytes tend to be larger and, therefore, more problematic than posterior osteophytes",

These growths occur along the edges of any bone in the body because of cartilage breakdown, connective tissue calcification, or trauma.",
      "Osteophytosis. Osteophytes, more commonly known as bone spurs, are outgrowths of bone tissue that form around damaged joints. This bone growth is thought to be a compensatory response to bone and ligament damage, and is meant to restrict movement of the joint to protect from further damage.",
      "Osteophytes form because of the increase in a damaged joint's surface area. This is most common from the onset of arthritis. Osteophytes usually limit joint movement and typically cause pain. Osteophytes form naturally on the back of the spine as a person ages and are a sign of degeneration in the spine. In this case, the spurs are not the source of back pains, but instead are the common symptom of a deeper problem. Osteophytes, commonly referred to as bone spurs or parrot beak, are bony projections that form along joint margins. They should not be confused with enthesophytes, which are bony projections that form at the attachment of a tendon or ligament."

Its origin extends below to within 2.5 cm of the margin of the articular surface of the humerus at the elbow joint. The brachialis muscle and brachial muscle can be considered as the anglicized variant of the Latin expression musculus bracchialis. In classical Latin bracchialis means of or belonging to the arm, and is derived from classical Latin bracchium ,arm.",
      "The brachialis muscle is located in the upper arm. It lies underneath the biceps muscle. It acts as a structural bridge between the humerus, which is the bone of the upper arm, and the ulna, which is one of the forearm bones. The muscle is innervated by both the musculoskeletal nerve and the radial nerve. In some people, the muscle may appear doubled. Also called the brachialis anticus, its primary action is to flex the forearm muscles at the elbow. Due to its high contractile strength, the branchialis makes many arm and elbow movements possible. Such movements are important for the activities of daily life",

The Elite-Kold Wrist and Elbow Ice Wrap is a good choice for brachialis pain. I like this wrap because it can be used for the elbow and forearm. To treat the brachialis muscle, begin with the wrap at the elbow then reposition the wrap to treat the wrist, thumb, and thumb pad (20 minutes per position).",

In addition, the origin tendon attaches to the medial and lateral intermuscular septa of the arm, two dividing membranes separating the flexor from the extensor muscles. Pathology. In cases of extreme strain of the elbow, inflammation of the brachialis tendon (brachialis tendonitis) or injuries of the joint capsule often occur. Too many pull-ups, excessive tennis practice or other inappropriate strain of the elbow are among the typical causes."

      "Frequently Asked Questions. Galling is the term used when two surfaces in contact seize up as a result of cold welding. The problem (also known as 'adhesive wear') is most commonly seen when tightening bolts made from materials such as stainless steel, aluminium or titanium. 1 Firstly, lubricate the bolt threads and/or inner threads of the nut, either pre-applied by the supplier or applied during assembly. 2  Many anti-galling lubricants contain molybdenum compounds, but if the application is for the food industry there may be limitations on what chemical lubricants are acceptable.",
      "Galling is most commonly found in metal surfaces that are in sliding contact with each other. It is especially common where there is inadequate lubrication between the surfaces. However, certain metals will generally be more prone to galling, due to the atomic structure of their crystals. Galling is caused by macroscopic transfer of material between metallic surfaces, during transverse motion (sliding). Galling occurs frequently whenever metal surfaces are in contact, sliding against each other, especially with poor lubrication.",
      "Thread galling occurs during installation when pressure and friction cause bolt threads to seize to the threads of a nut or tapped hole. It is also known as  cold welding . Once a fastener has seized up from galling it is typically impossible to remove without cutting the bolt or splitting the nut. Galling is most often seen in stainless steel (especially when using lock nuts), aluminum, and titanium. Fasteners with damaged threads and fine threads are particularly prone to galling."

      "In an English-language context, the name Jah is now most commonly associated with the Rastafari. It is otherwise mostly limited to the phrase Hallelujah and theophoric names such as Elijah. In the Authorized King James Version (1611) there is only a single instance of JAH (capitalised) in only one instance, in Psalm 68 :4. An American Translation (1939) follows KJV in using Yah in this verse. Jah is referenced in many reggae songs. The popularity of this music form associated with the Rastafari has spread the name Jah (derived from the KJV Psalms 68:4) beyond the West Indies. For example, it is referenced in Bob Marley 's . Is this Love , in the line: We'll share the same room, for Jah provide the bread."

This substance is a part of protein and is found in many foods. Without the enzyme to break it down, phenylalanine can build up to dangerous levels. Babies are usually screened for PKU with a heel-prick test. This requires drawing a few drops of blood from the infant's heel. A urine test is an alternative to the heel prick. The healthcare provider will collect a sample of your baby's urine.",

      "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition in which the body cannot break down one of the amino acids found in proteins. PKU is considered an amino acid condition because people with PKU cannot break down the amino acid called phenylalanine. If left untreated, PKU can cause brain damage or even death. Your baby will need to be on a restricted diet to avoid phenylalanine, a building block of proteins that individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down. Phenylalanine is found in all foods that contain protein and also in artificial sweeteners."

      "LOCATION: The tundra biome is the coldest of all biomes. It is also quite big. The tundra covers about one fifth of the land on earth. The word tundra comes from a Finnish word that means treeless plain, which is a good description of the biome. WEATHER: The tundra is the coldest and the driest of all the biomes on Earth. There is very little rainfall in the tundra; it rains less than ten inches a year. Winters here are long, and summers short, sometimes they last for only 6 - 10 weeks. In the winter the temperature can reach -50°F (-45.5°C).",
      "There are two types of tundra-arctic tundra and alpine tundra. The arctic tundra is located within the Arctic Circle while the alpine tundra is the area high in the mountains above trees. The plants that grow in the tundra biome often grow in clusters to help protect themselves from the severe winter winds. There are very few trees that grow in the tundra biome. Under the snow and ice, there is a thick layer of soil that remains frozen which does not allow deep rooted plants such as trees to grow. The tundra biome has about 400 varieties of flowers but only 48 different animals."

The dhat syndrome has been found in several cultures and they often go by different names. However, the syndrome is most prevalent in India. The article “Dhat Syndrome: A reappraisal” describes the origin of the condition, how it affects the body and how it should be treated.",
      "The naming of dhat syndrome came from the Indian culture, more specifically the Sanskrit word, “dhatu” which meant ‘elixir’ or ‘constituent of the body.’ Men suffering from dhat syndrome experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, anxiety, loss of appetite, and sexual dysfunction. ",
      "Abstract. Background Culture-bound syndrome is a term used to describe the uniqueness of some syndromes in specific cultures. Dhat (semen-loss anxiety) has been considered to be an exotic ‘neurosis of the Orient’. Aims To ascertain the presence of similar symptoms and syndromes in different cultures and historical settings. ",
      "Background. Dhat syndrome is a widely recognized clinical condition often seen on the Indian subcontinent that is characterized by a preoccupation with semen loss in urine and other symptoms such as fatigue or depressed mood. Dhat syndrome is currently classified as a culture-bound syndrome in DSM-IV-R, although the diagnostic criteria may change in the future. Indeed, a debate is underway about the suitability of considering culture-bound syndromes as specific illnesses.",
      "Overview. Dhat syndrome is a condition found in the cultures of the Indian subcontinent in which male patients report that they suffer from premature ejaculation or impotence, and believe that they are passing semen in their urine. In traditional Hindu spirituality, semen is described as a 'vital fluid'. Some doctors believe dhat syndrome to be either a culture-bound presentation of clinical depression as a somatized set of symptoms or a result of Western doctors' misinterpretation of patients' descriptions of their condition. It is very common in Pakistani culture as well"

There's a grade one, where the ligament that holds the joint in place is stretched. There's sometimes a grade two, where you can get some tearing of the ligament, or a grade three, where it is torn completely. As you can imagine, that's going to really impact just how long it takes for that ligament to heal itself back together. General rule of thumb, say for ankle sprain, perhaps a grade one: two, three weeks; grade two: four weeks; and a grade three: sometimes four, six weeks -- sometimes longer. Comments. "

      "Epigenetics literally means above or on top of genetics. It refers to external modifications to DNA that turn genes on or off.. These modifications do not change the DNA sequence, but instead, they affect how cells read genes. Examples of epigenetics. Epigenetic changes alter the physical structure of DNA. One example of an epigenetic change is DNA methylation — the addition of a methyl group, or a chemical cap, to part of the DNA molecule, which prevents certain genes from being expressed. Another example is histone modification. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around",
      "The term epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression (active versus inactive genes) that does not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence; a change in phenotype without a change in genotype. At least three systems including DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing are currently considered to initiate and sustain epigenetic change. New and ongoing research is continuously uncovering the role of epigenetics in a variety of human disorders and fatal diseases.",

Epigenetics is the study, in the field of genetics, of cellular and physiological phenotypic trait variations that are caused by external or environmental factors that switch genes on and off and affect how cells read genes instead of being caused by changes in the DNA sequence. Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are DNA methylation and histone modification, each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA.",

The field is analogous to genomics and proteomics, which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell (Russell 2010 p. 217 & 230). Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis (Russell 2010 p. 597).",
      "Introduction. The term epigenetics was first used to refer to the complex interactions between the genome and the environment that are involved in development and differentiation in higher organisms. Today, this term is used to refer to heritable alterations that are not due to changes in DNA sequence. Rather, epigenetic modifications, or tags, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, alter DNA accessibility and chromatin structure, thereby regulating patterns of gene expression. More recent studies in animal models have begun to characterize epigenetic modifications that are influenced by the intrauterine environment. For example, feeding a low-protein diet to pregnant rats causes low birth weight, hypertension, and endothelial dysfunction in the offspring."

But factors contributing to less saliva production and/or thickened saliva may be risk factors for salivary stones. Trauma to the salivary glands may also raise the risk for salivary stones. The stones cause no symptoms as they form, but if they reach a size that blocks the duct, saliva backs up into the gland, causing pain and swelling. You may feel the pain off and on, and it may get progressively worse.",

The following are some of the more common salivary gland problems : Salivary stones, or sialoliths. The most common cause of swollen salivary glands, salivary stones are buildups of crystallized saliva deposits. Sometimes salivary stones can block the flow of saliva. When saliva can't exit through the ducts, it backs up into the gland, causing pain and swelling. Pain is usually off and on, is felt in one gland, and gets progressively worse. Unless the blockage is cleared, the gland is likely to become infected",
      "A salivary gland stone -- also called salivary duct stone -- is a calcified structure that may form inside a salivary gland or duct. It can block the flow of saliva into the mouth. The majority of stones affect the submandibular glands located at the floor of the mouth. Trauma to the salivary glands may also raise the risk for salivary stones. The stones cause no symptoms as they form, but if they reach a size that blocks the duct, saliva backs up into the gland, causing pain and swelling.

Thick blood is caused by heavy proteins, or by too much blood in the circulation. Too many red cells, white cells, and platelets will result in blood thickening. Another cause is an imbalance in the blood clotting system. Specific diseases include lupus, inhibitors, deficiency in protein C or S or antithrombin, or mutations in Factor 5 or prothrombin. Cancer can also cause blood thickening. Not all blood clots are caused by thick blood. Blood clots leading to heart attacks and strokes can be formed when thin blood comes into contact with plaque, which triggers a blood clot.

      "1 Esophageal peristalsis results from sequential contraction of circular muscle, which serves to push the ingested food bolus toward the stomach. 2  Esophageal longitudinal muscle may also play a role in peristalsis. Esophageal peristalsis consists of sequential contraction of the circular muscles of the muscularis propria, which is largely mediated by acetylcholine. This sequential contraction serves to occlude the esophageal lumen and push the bolus aborally.",
      "1 Peristalsis in the striated muscle part of the esophagus is dependent on central mechanisms, involving sequential activation of vagal lower motor neurons in the vagal nucleus ambiguus. 2  Peristalsis in the smooth muscle of the esophagus is dependent on both central and peripheral mechanisms. Esophageal peristalsis consists of sequential contraction of the circular muscles of the muscularis propria, which is largely mediated by acetylcholine. This sequential contraction serves to occlude the esophageal lumen and push the bolus aborally.",
      "Fiber stimulates peristalsis by adding bulk, which in turn distends intestinal walls and activates peristaltic activity. Beans are one of the top sources of fiber, with 1/2 cup containing 6 to 9.6 grams of fiber, or 24 percent to 38 percent of the daily value based on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. Any food you eat stimulates nerves, which trigger peristaltic action in the muscles. But the type of food you eat, the amount you consume and the frequency of your meals all have an impact on peristalsis."

      "The continual cycling of the fluid is called a convection current. Convection currents are found in many places and on many scales, from huge convection currents in the atmosphere, oceans, and even in the earth's interior to smaller convection currents found in a cup of hot cocoa or a fish tank. Heat moves in fluids through several processes, including convection. Convection is the transfer of heat by the actual movement of the heated material. Any substance that flows is considered a fluid. This includes such things as water, shampoo, sunscreen, and even honey.",
      "Many geologists believe that the mantle flows because of convection currents. Convection currents are caused by the very hot material at the deepest part of the mantle rising, then cooling, sinking again and then heating, rising and repeating the cycle over and over. The next time you heat anything like soup or pudding in a pan you can watch the convection currents move in the liquid. When the convection currents flow in the mantle they also move the crust. The crust gets a free ride with these currents. A conveyor belt in a factory moves boxess like the convection currents in the mantle moves the plates of the Earth.",

About forty percent of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica.

The hares, rabbits and pikas (order Lagomorpha) have continuously growing incisors, as do rodents, and were at one time included in the order.",
      "No, a rabbit is not a rodent (i.e. Rodentia order). Rabbits are lagomorphs (i.e. Lagomorpha order, along with hares and pikas). More specifically, they're leporids (i.e. Lepor … idae family). Rabbits are similar to rodents in that their teeth continue to grow throughout their lives; thus, rabbits, like pet rodents, need things to gnaw on to wear their teeth down. Rabbits are unlike rodents in these ways: - They have four incisor teeth in the upper jaw instead of two-They're herbivores instead of omnivores-The male genitalia has slight differences as well Other Answers Nope, rabbits are Lagomorphs like hares.",
      "The order lagomorpha has two families: Leporidae (rabbits and hares), and Ochotonidae (pikas). Rabbits and hares used to belong to the order Rodentia, but, because they have four incisor teeth (instead of two) and are strictly herbivorous (rodents will sometimes eat meat), they are lagomorphs. Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often mistaken. Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new order Lagomorpha. This order also includes pikas.",
      "Best Answer: This is a common and understandlable mistake that many people make. Rabbits or bunnies are not rodents. They are actually in a Order called Lagamorpha, which includes rabbits, hares, and a small South American animal called the pika. All rodents belong to an order called Rodentia",
      "Rabbits are mammals of the order Lagomorpha. There are about fifty different species of rabbits and hares. The order Lagomorpha is made of rabbits, pikas and hares. Rabbits can be found in many parts of the world. They live in families and eat vegetables and hay."

      "Bath salts is a term used in North America to describe a number of recreational designer drugs. The name derives from instances in which the drugs were sold disguised as true bath salts. The white powder, granules, or crystals often resemble true bath salts such as Epsom salts, but are very different chemically. The drugs' packaging often states not for human consumption in an attempt to circumvent drug prohibition laws.

Bath salts aren’t just for bathing; you can use bath salts as scrubs, cleansers, and more. You can use smaller-grain bath salts as scrubs for exfoliation. Bath salts also come in a variety of scents and fragrances, and are often infused with herbs and essential oils. You can use bath salts that are scented, or you can use plain, unscented bath salts. It’s easy to use bath salts. For a bath, fill the tub about halfway to the desired level",
      "The “bath salts” discussed in the media are substances of abuse. They are “designer drugs,” meaning that they are not found in nature and instead are cooked up in a lab. The main drugs being sold as “bath salts” are Methylenedioxypyrovalerone and mephedrone. Like MDPV, Mephedrone is a powerful stimulant and a designer drug. It is occasionally marketed as plant food but is also part of some “bath salts.” It has very similar effects to MDPV, ecstasy, and cocaine. The reported sense of well-being produced by mephedrone is more similar to ecstasy than cocaine.",

The term “bath salts” refers to an emerging family of drugs containing one or more synthetic chemicals related to cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant found naturally in the khat plant.

      "Comments. The tennis players on the WTA and ATP tour are from all over the world, each having a unique name, and a unique way of saying it too. To me, pronouncing their names in their native language is the correct way of saying their name. When it comes to saying the names of the pros, you have to first have a relaxed mouth and tongue. If you are tense in any way, it will come out incorrectly. If you are nervous at all, you have to tell yourself to relax—example, if you say these names in public when you are not yet comfortable.",

All ports in a single VLAN are in a single broadcast domain. 1 All devices, by default, are in VLAN 1. 2  A trunk port is a special port that runs ISL or 802.1q so that it can carry traffic from more than one VLAN. 3  For devices in different VLAN’s to communicate, you must use a router or Layer 3 switch."

These tables can be extended when more seating is needed yet are self-stored, and so they do not require additional storage space. When the leaf is not in use, it folds neatly underneath the table, hidden from sight. History. An early version of a drop-leaf dining table was the gate-leg table, the two extra legs of which were swung out when needed to support the table's leaves. While that kind of table was used in Colonial America from the late 1600s, butterfly tables were developed there about 1710.",

      "Best Answer: I always bake bread and rolls in a 375 F preheated oven. Check your bread after about 30 minutes. It may need 5 or 10 more minutes, but better to check it early.

      "The melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a solid is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at standard pressure. When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. The melting point of a pure substance is always higher and has a smaller range than the melting point of an impure substance or, more generally, of mixtures.

It is an optical characteristic of water and is an expression of the amount of light that is scattered by material in the water when a light is shined through the water sample. The higher the intensity of scattered light, the higher the turbidity.",

In lakes the turbidity is measured with a secchi disk (in the picture). This is a black and white disk that is dropped in the water attached to a rope. The depth that the disk reaches before it disappears from sight is recorded. This provides an estimation of the turbidity level in the lake. ",

Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by large numbers of individual particles that are generally invisible to the naked eye, similar to smoke in air. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid. Turbidity (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5° from the incoming light direction.",

While rayon can be made with cellulose from a variety of plants, viscose is made from wood pulp or cotton linter. 4.Viscose rayon can also be less durable than other types of rayon because it is made with a high concentration of caustic soda while other types of rayon use less.",
      "Rayon is the generic term for fiber (and the resulting yarn and fabric) manufactured of regenerated cellulose by any one of six processes. Its importance as a fiber lies in its versatility, and in the fact that it was the first viable manufactured fiber. 1 Absorbency: Rayon is the most absorbent of all cellulose fibers, even more so than cotton and linen. 2  Because of this, rayon absorbs perspiration and allows it to evaporate away from the skin, making it an excellent summer fabric. 3  Its high absorbency applies equally to dyes, allowing beautiful, deep, rich colours.",
      "Viscose. Viscose is both a semi-synthetic fabric formerly called viscose rayon or rayon and a solution of cellulose xanthate produced by treating dissolving pulp with aqueous sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide used to spin the viscose rayon fiber. Viscose rayon fiber is a soft fiber commonly used in dresses, linings, shirts, shorts, coats, jackets, and other outer wear; it is also used in industrial yarns (tyre cord), upholstery and carpets.",
      "Viscose rayon is a fiber of regenerated cellulose; it is structurally similar to cotton but may be produced from a variety of plants such as soy, bamboo, and sugar cane. Cellulose is a linear polymer of β-D-glucose units with the empirical formula (C 6 H 10 O 5) n. Viscose rayon fiber is a soft fiber commonly used in dresses, linings, shirts, shorts, coats, jackets, and other outer wear; it is also used in industrial yarns (tyre cord), upholstery and carpets.",
      "Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber. Specific types of rayon include viscose, modal and lyocell, each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product. While rayon may be produced from bamboo as a raw material, and both rayon and bamboo may be used for similar fabrics, rayon is so far removed from bamboo by chemical processing that the two are entirely separate."

      "Vinca (/ˈvɪŋkə/ ; Latin: vincire to bind, fetter) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, native to Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Asia. The English name periwinkle is shared with the related genus Catharanthus (and also with the common seashore mollusc, Littorina littorea). Two of the species, Vinca major and Vinca minor, are extensively cultivated as a flowering evergreen ornamental plant. Because the plants are low and spread quickly, they are often used as groundcover in garden landscapes and container gardens.",
      "Step 4. Make sure the plant is getting some sunlight. The vinca vine grows wonderfully as a groundcover under the bases of trees, but still needs some sunlight to get through to it for part of the day to produce flowers. Thin out or cut back some of the overhead branches to allow some light to get through to your vinca plants. Step 1. Vinca vines can slow down in their growth if they have been growing in one spot for several years, forming a thick mat of stems and roots. Thin out the mass by pulling out about two thirds of the plants.",
      "Overview. Vinca vines are also known by the names of Creeping Myrtle, Periwinkle, and Vinca minor. These vines will grow about six inches high and will send out vines about 18 inches long that will root and continue spreading, slowly forming a thick ground cover. Step 1. Vinca vines can slow down in their growth if they have been growing in one spot for several years, forming a thick mat of stems and roots. Thin out the mass by pulling out about two thirds of the plants.",
      "5. Check the plant's leaves for aphids or mites when you water the plant. Wash off small insect populations with a steady stream of water in the morning. Spray heavily infested plants with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil to eradicate the pests. Make the cut 1/8 to 1/4 inch above the second set of leaves using a pair of pruning snips",
      "Appearance. Vincas are mat flowers, which means they spread and grow into a mat or mound shape. Some are bred specifically to be used as annual bedding plants. These vincas grow to about 12 inches tall and form mats about 8 inches wide. Others are primarily used as ground covers. These average about 6 inches tall and spread to 24 inches wide."

I first encountered ASMR, as do most people, as a child. I never knew exactly what it was. Aside from the pleasurable sensation that ASMR offers there are a range of other benefits. Many intentional ASMR videos are essentially forms of guided meditations, meditating regularly has been shown to reduce stress levels and aid concentration among many other things.",

Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a neologism for a perceptual phenomenon characterized as a distinct, pleasurable tingling sensation in the head, scalp, back, or peripheral regions of the body in response to visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or cognitive stimuli. Other triggers may include goal-oriented tasks, soft-speaking, role-playing, and music.

For example, if someone crinkles bags next to a 3D microphone, or pretends to do my make up (i.e: brushing the screen), I get this tingling feeling in my head and I fall asleep almost in minutes.

If you can’t find anything that triggers the ASMR sensation for you, the only other way (that I know of) to experience the sensation is with a head massaging tool called the orgasmatron. Personally this produces tingles that are much more intense than any other ASMR trigger for me. Question: I am new to ASMR and have yet to find any triggers that cause me to have the ‘tingles.’ (I have experienced the ‘tingles’ in real life situations, so I know what the sensation is, I just can’t remember what triggered them!)

      "The periodic table is an arrangement of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers, electron configurations and recurring chemical properties. Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number. The standard form of the table consists of a grid of elements, with rows called periods and columns called groups. The history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of chemical properties. The Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev was the first scientist to make a periodic table similar to the one used today. Mendeleev arranged the elements by atomic mass, corresponding to relative molar mass.",
      "Answer: If you answered Dmitri Mendeleev then you might be incorrect. Dmitri Mendeleev presented his periodic table of the elements based on increasing atomic weight on March 6, 1869, in a presentation to the Russian Chemical Society. While Mendeleev's table was the first to gain some acceptance in the scientific community, it was not the first table of its kind. A year earlier (1864) Lothar Meyer published a periodic table which described the placement of 28 elements. Meyer's periodic table ordered the elements into groups arranged in order of their atomic weights.",

Oculocutaneous albinism is generally the result of the biological inheritance of genetically recessive alleles (genes) passed from both parents of an individual for example OCA1 and OCA2.",
      "All the genetic traits for albinism are recessive traits. This means that their influence is hidden when paired with stronger traits. For the recessive albino trait to be expressed in a mammal, the offspring must inherit a recessive gene from both parents. Albinism in biology is the Congenital absence of any pigmentation or coloration in a person, animal or plant, resulting in white hair and pink eyes in mammals.. Varied use and interpretation of the terms means that written reports of albinistic animals can be difficult to verify.",
      "When both parents carry the albinism gene (and neither parent has albinism) there is a one in four chance at each pregnancy that the baby will be born with albinism. This type of inheritance is called “autosomal recessive” inheritance. Ocular albinism (OA1) is caused by a change in the GPR143 gene that plays a signaling role that is especially important to pigmentation in the eye. OA1 follows a simpler pattern of inheritance because the gene for OA1 is on the X chromosome. • OCA1, or tyrosinase-related albinism, results from a genetic defect in an enzyme called tyrosinase. This enzyme helps the body to change the amino acid, tyrosine, into pigment. (An amino acid is a “building block” of protein.) There are two subtypes of OCA1.",

More detailed information about the symptoms, causes, and treatments of Albinism, ocular, autosomal recessive is available below. ",
      "Most people with albinism are born to parents without the condition, but both parents must carry a copy of the defective gene and both must pass on that copy to their child. Albinism is a recessive trait, meaning that if a person inherits even one good copy of the gene, he or she will not have the condition. Each time parents who both carry the trait have a child, there is a 25 percent chance that the child will have albinism regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl. 1 Type 1 albinism: This form of albinism is characterized by almost no pigmentation and is caused by a defect in a gene for an enzyme * that makes pigment. 2  Type 2 albinism: People with Type 2 albinism usually have some pigmentation; this type is caused by a defect in a gene called the P gene."

Severity of disease and time of diagnosis are two such factors. Using data from the CF Foundation Patient Registry, which is gathered from patients treated at CF Foundation-accredited care centers, we do know that more than 40 percent of all people with CF in this country are 18 years or older. In addition, we have calculated the predicted median age of survival.",
      "In fact, as recently as the 1960s, most children with cystic fibrosis did not live past preschool age [source: Cystic Fibrosis Canada ]. Moreover, not so long ago in the 1980s, people with cystic fibrosis had an average life expectancy of 14 years. The life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has drastically improved over the last three decades.",
      "In men, CF can affect their ability to have children. Breakthrough treatments have added years to the lives of people with cystic fibrosis. Today the median predicted survival age is close to 40. This is a dramatic improvement from the 1950s, when a child with CF rarely lived long enough to attend elementary school. People with cystic fibrosis are at greater risk of getting lung infections because thick, sticky mucus builds up in their lungs, allowing germs to thrive and multiply. Lung infections, caused mostly by bacteria, are a serious and chronic problem for many people living with the disease."

      "Overview. American transcendentalism was an important movement in philosophy and literature that flourished during the early to middle years of the nineteenth century (about 1836-1860). It was based on a monism holding to the unity of the world and God, and the immanence of God in the world (Oxford Companion to American Literature 770). For the transcendentalists, the soul of each individual is identical with the soul of the world and contains what the world contains.",

You will see by this sketch that there is no such thing as a transcendental party; that there is no pure transcendentalist; that we know of no one but prophets and heralds of such a philosophy; that all who by strong bias of nature have leaned to the spiritual side in doctrine, have stopped short of their goal.",

Wisdom is generally regarded as being deposited in societal laws and traditions and accrued by individuals through life experience. First, Tornstam regards gerotranscendence as a radical reformulation of the disengagement theory promulgated in the early 1960s by Elaine Cumming and colleagues (Cumming, 1963, Cumming and Henry, 1961 and Cumming and Newell, 1960).",
      "This is true to a degree although others (Joan Erikson in Erikson and Erikson, 1997 and Johnson and Barer, 1993) see Tornstam’s theory as being more concerned with liberation in the present. It has to be noted that the suggestion of Erikson et al. First, Tornstam regards gerotranscendence as a radical reformulation of the disengagement theory promulgated in the early 1960s by Elaine Cumming and colleagues (Cumming, 1963, Cumming and Henry, 1961 and Cumming and Newell, 1960).",
      "The theory of gerotranscendence is based not only on a given research paradigm but also on a paradigm about the individual. Tornstam does not state explicitly how he regards the individual, but it appears that he considers him to be a biological and social being. The concept of gerotranscendence is based primarily on logic, since it is developed on the basis of a theory. The concept has been developed within the gerontological theory tradition, and Tornstam states that the disengagement theory has been very important to him.",
      "“Only when we are so old, only, we are aware of the beauty of life.” Alice Herz Sommer, age 106. A few weeks ago I was in a university library when I happened upon a book quite by accident called Gerotranscendence: A Developmental Theory of Positive Aging by Lars Tornstam, PhD (2005) . As Tornstam puts it, many of us have a tendency to define the present age or time of life as the best one and how the rest of life/our lives should be. We can understand that this may not be true in retrospect, but have difficulty doing so in prospect."

With passing of British North Act in 1867, Canada became a dominion in the British Commonwealth and this did not mean that it was a fully independent country. Canada evolves over the years to become a one of the best countries. ",

Over a hundred years Canada continued to assert its  independence from Britain through actions such … as building their  own navy. Canada officially became a country in 1982. 2 people found this useful. Making the world better, one answer at a time. It happened gradually over time. In 1867 Canada did officially become a country but under the British Crown it still had colonial status.",

      "There are a number of events that contributed to Canada's full independence. The British North America Act (1867) created the self-governing Dominion. Britain continued to manage Canada's international affairs. Many agree Canada became a nation in its own right through its contribution in World War I. Canada automatically entered the war when Britain declared war on Germany. At the end of the war Canada signed the Treaty of Versailles (1919) as a nation, and became a member of the League of Nations. The Statute of Westminster (1931) was a large contributor to Canada's Independence",
      "Canada became a country in 1867, but the story of the people and the land that would become Canada is much older. Many events over the last five hundred years have shaped the way Canada looked at the time of Confederation. In the 1500s explorers from Europe came to North America to claim lands. "

This difference enables the resultant double-strand DNA formed to be composed of two DNA strands that are antiparallel to each other. Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp) that synthesizes DNA from a template of RNA. The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA.",

This is in contrast to a typical DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which catalyzes the transcription of RNA from a DNA template. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of all RNA-containing viruses with no DNA stage that have sense negative RNA. It catalyses synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template. The RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. ",
      "For genes to be expressed, a complementary strand of RNA must be produced from a DNA template. During this process of transcription, a special class of enzyme called RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template, reading the DNA and producing an RNA complement. To transcribe DNA to RNA, an enzyme moves along one half of an unwound DNA helix, adding nucleotides to a nascent RNA strand. One such enzyme, pol II, transcribes portions of DNA that specifically encode proteins into messenger RNA.",

If you are in a hurry you can download our guide to measuring battery life here. A size 13 battery stores more energy than a size 312, which stores more energy than a size 10A. So, this is going to be a factor in calculating how long the battery will last in a hearing aid.",
      "Just like the gas tank in your car, the larger the tank, the further you can drive before filling up. A size 13 battery stores more energy than a size 312, which stores more energy than a size 10A. So, this is going to be a factor in calculating how long the battery will last in a hearing aid. This stored energy has a value called milliamp hours. And though this value may differ depending on battery manufacturer, there are some default values you can use for your calculation",

I only get 2 days out of my 312 battery why can’t I get 15 to 20 hours with them or even 5-10.",
      "In a recent market survey we performed, device users were asked how long their hearing aid batteries last. For size 10 batteries, people were experiencing anywhere from 3 to 10 days; for size 312, from 3 to 12 days; for size 13, from 6 to 14 days; for size 675, from 9 to 20 days. ",
      "The more active you are, the more power your hearing aid may need in order to perform all of its sound cleaning and restoration functions. If you are curious how long your hearing aid batteries should last, ask your hearing healthcare provider. They will be able to calculate the life expectancy of the batteries used in your particular hearing aid. Knowing what to expect from your hearing aid will allow you to plan accordingly and hear with confidence. And, it depends on the circuitry in the hearing aid, too. Some hearing aids are constantly working to improve the sound quality and reduce noise. These “automatic” hearing aids generally require more battery power."

The answer to this question is a resounding YES! “You can save someone’s life,” stresses Karen Whiting, a training specialist with the American Red Cross.",
      "In the world of CPR we have those who think that CPR training is a good idea and everyone should get it and we have those who hate CPR training and only do it because it is required. The people who think it is a good idea rarely, if ever, get the actual training."

      "Acrylic is a useful, clear plastic that resembles glass, but has properties that make it superior to glass in many ways. Common brands of high-grade acrylic include Polycast, Lucite and Plexiglass. There are two basic types of acrylic: extruded and cell cast. Extruded or continuous cast acrylic is made by a less expensive process, is softer, can scratch easier and may contain impurities.",
      "Definition: Acrylic is synthetic material with a wide range of possible end uses. Acrylic can be made into yarn or fabric as well as many other types of products. In the book Textiles: Fiber to Fabric. The author, Dr. Bernard P. Corbman, explains that basically, acrylic is a type of plastic.. The Federal Trade Commission defines acrylic in the following way:",
      "Background. Acrylic plastic refers to a family of synthetic, or man-made, plastic materials containing one or more derivatives of acrylic acid. The most common acrylic plastic is polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), which is sold under the brand names of Plexiglas, Lucite, Perspex, and Crystallite. PMMA is a tough, highly transparent material with excellent resistance to ultraviolet radiation and weathering. It can be colored, molded, cut, drilled, and formed. Like all plastics, acrylic plastics are polymers. The word polymer comes from the Greek words poly, meaning many, and meros, meaning a part. A polymer, therefore, is a material made up of many molecules, or parts, linked together like a chain.",
      "Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), also known as acrylic or acrylic glass as well as by the trade names Plexiglas, Acrylite, Lucite, and Perspex among several others (see below), is a transparent thermoplastic often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. Plastic is a material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organics that are malleable and can be molded into solid objects of diverse shapes.",
      "Acrylic fabric is used widely in knits, as upholstery covering, and the fibers may be woven to make rugs. People often think of acrylic fabric as an excellent wool substitute, and certain forms of it are exceptionally soft, while remaining lightweight. Early acrylic fabric was prone to pilling, and washing it regularly could cause the top of the fabric to have a worn appearance. To this end, Monsanto Chemical Company developed a chemical process called Pil-Trol® that keeps acrylic fabric from pilling."

      "The Watson and Crick Model. After learning that DNA had spiral shape, Watson and Crick determined the structure of DNA. The sugar and phosphate groups are bonded in alternating sequences to form the sides of a twisted ladder. Bases are joined by hydrogen bonds to form the rungs of the ladder. ",
      "Confidence votes 7.6K. A DNA molecule is like a ladder because there are two sides (the sugar-phosphate backbones of the two strands) and rungs (each rung being a pair of complementary bases). Twisted, because the molecule is twined in a coil called a helix-or rather, a double helix because there are two strands. The model is called a double helix because two long strands twist around each other like a twisted ladder. The rails of the ladder are made of alternating sugar and phosphate … ... The basic building block of DNA is called a NUCLEOTIDE.",
      "Concept 19 The DNA molecule is shaped like a twisted ladder. Earlier work had shown that DNA is composed of building blocks called nucleotides consisting of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogen bases — adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Phosphates and sugars of adjacent nucleotides link to form a long polymer. Other key experiments showed that the ratios of A-to-T and G-to-C are constant in all living things. X-ray crystallography provided the final clue that the DNA molecule is a double helix, shaped like a twisted ladder. In 1953, the race to determine how these pieces fit together in a three-dimensional structure was won by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England. They showed that alternating deoxyribose and phosphate molecules form the twisted uprights of the DNA ladder. The rungs of the ladder are formed by complementary pairs of nitrogen bases — A always paired with T and G always paired with C.",

In this analogy, the rungs of the ladder are the base pairs (A-T and G-C). The sides of the ladder are the sugar-phosphate backbones of the two strands. This refers to B form DNA. Each strand is composed of nucleotides. A nucleotide consists of a base (a purine or pyrimidine), a sugar (between the other two components) named deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. Nucleotides are linked to each other via phosphodiester bonds, forming a sugar-phosphate backbone to each strand."

Humans share a common ancestor with modern African apes, like gorillas and chimpanzees."

      "Welcome. Thank you for visiting Master Thatchers (North) Ltd. website. ‘Celebrating 30 Years of Thatching 1985-2015′. The website is very large with a lot of content on our thatching work, re-thatching, re-ridging and thatch repairs and we hope you find it informative and interesting. ",
      "Thatching is the craft of building a roof with dry vegetation such as straw, water reed, sedge (Cladium mariscus), rushes, or heather, layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof. It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both tropical and temperate climates. Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries, usually with low-cost, local vegetation. By contrast in some developed countries it is now the choice of affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home, would like a more ecologically friendly roof, or who have purchased an originally thatched abode.",
      "Artificial thatch is a cost effective and smart alternative to natural thatch products that generally need to be replaced every 5 years. Building structures with artificial thatch roofing mimic the same luxurious palapa structures that are made from natural thatch products. ",
      "When thatched properly by professionals, the major portion of such a roof (the water reed) should last 40 to 50 years. In other words, as long as any other roof. However, the roof ridge will have to be replaced roughly every 8 - 10 years. Houses, commercial establishments, heritage centers, holiday villages-you name it, we've probably thatched one. There is a practical consideration-the roof should have a slope no less than 45 degrees (12 inches in 12 inches) to aid in the shedding of water.",
      "The thatching cost usually is based on the area of roof to be thatched. Thatchers work on “square”. feet by. (. square feet). The average roof is around. square although some properties are 4 square and some. square. The cost also depends on factors such as:-. 1  Shape of the roof. 2  Design of the roof. 3  Ridge type and style."

Damage to the nerves of the spinal cord affects different parts of the body, depending on the amount of damage and where it occurred. In rare cases, no physical cause for paralysis can be found. Psychologists call this condition a conversion disorder—that is, a person converts his or her psychological anxiety into physical symptoms of paralysis, but nerve and muscle function are still intact.",
